Implement a function `check` which takes two non-negative integers as parameters `speed` and `limit`. If `speed` is greater than `limit`, the function should return `False`, otherwise it should return `True`. However, if `limit` is `0`, the function should return `True` whatever the value of `speed`.

You may assume that your function will only be called with parameters that match the given description.
