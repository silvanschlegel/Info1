Implement a function `print_range` which takes three numbers as parameters `start`, `stop` and `step`. The function should *print* numbers beginning at `start` in increments of `step` up to (but not including) `stop`, one number per line. You can assume that `start` will never be larger than `stop` and that `step` is always positive. Note that this function does not return anything.

Important: even though there are various ways to solve this task, you **must** use a while loop to solve this problem and you may not use `range()`.

You may assume that your function will only be called with parameters that match the given description.
