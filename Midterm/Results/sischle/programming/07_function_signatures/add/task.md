Implement a function `add` which can take two numbers as parameters `a` and `b`. Both parameters are optional and shall be `0` by default. The function should return the sum of  `a` and `b`.

**Important**: In this task, you must write the function signature yourself. Make sure that your function is called `add`.

You may assume that your function will only be called with parameters that match the given description.
