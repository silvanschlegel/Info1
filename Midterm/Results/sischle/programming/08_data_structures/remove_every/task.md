Implement a function `remove_every` which takes two parameters: a list `l`(containing arbitrary values) and a positive integer `n`.  The function should return a list containing the elements from `l` but with every `n`'th element removed. For example, if `n` is 3, every third element should be removed.

You may assume that your function will only be called with parameters that match the given description.
